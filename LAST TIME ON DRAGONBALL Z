Normalize data, get rid of awful -2/-1 hell
Add Noise to data??
You need to shift -2 cards to other similar values to help massage it into a normal distribution.
Remove 100 samples from training data for VALIDATION ONLY. Use them to measure accuracy of predictions.

Un-normal outputs to get price amounts. (multiply by log(10) and then exponential them)

increase epochs by 20, reduce lr (learning rate by 10x).
maybe add multiple lines of model.fit? How to run model.fit multiple times

Research - Learning Rate Scheduler/Reduce on Plateau

Once all of these are mostly done, start playing with network again.

I finished a Tensorflow NN that worked with like 70% accuracy, but I didn't like it so I talked to Luke.

Now I'm doing a fully convolutional network with layers of average pooling and convolution.

What to do next:
Figure out what convolutional networks do, and their hyperparameters (filters, strides, etc.)
Figure out average pooling layers and their hyperparameters (...)
