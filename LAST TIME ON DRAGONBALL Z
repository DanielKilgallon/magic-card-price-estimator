I finished a Tensorflow NN that worked with like 70% accuracy, but I didn't like it so I talked to Luke.

Now I'm doing a fully convolutional network with layers of average pooling and convolution.

What to do next:
Figure out what convolutional networks do, and their hyperparameters (filters, strides, etc.)
Figure out average pooling layers and their hyperparameters (...)
